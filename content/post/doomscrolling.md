## rudiments of social media

**Infinite Scroll**: When you are bored and interested in quick dopamine, infinite scrolling feels to the consumer a lot like shopping with infinite wealth. Algorithms are built to rank and sort media presented to you to maximize how much attention you give that particular social media site (thereby increasing ad revenue). It's a brilliant business model and you have to give credit where it's due, but unbounded media is killing us. And personally, after a several hour doomscrolling session, I feel the regret and lethargy just like a drug addict (largely because it's the same kind of experience...). 

Examples:
- Instagram
- YouTube
- Reddit
- Snap Chat
- X
- LinkedIn
- Hackernews

**Notifications**: This module/system allows users to feel wanted by others. If you present the user with lots of notifications, it can feel just like having lots of friends who want to chat with you. It's implicit marketing for spending more time on the platform - check out this friend's vacation, this workout plan, or this new job. Just like with friends, notifications in moderation are perfect but social media sites inflate notifications to boost their engagement stats and time on site. It's just disgusting how many smart people have worked on this to make a quick profit.

**Stars**: This is a hand-wavy thought, but pay feels more and more Pareto distributed in that a small number of "stars" earn obscene amounts of money. Religion itself has deteriorated quite drastically, but we've replaced that with cult following of social media stars (Elon Musk, Jake Paul, Patrick Mahomes, etc.). Social media allows people to seem perfect just like religious leaders are and so I'd argue religions have multiplied in size (the social media stars).

Examples:
- Sports players (Juan Soto - 765 million over 15 years, Shohei Ohtani - 700 million over 10 years, etc.)
- CEOs (Hock Tan - 162 million, Tim Cook - 63.2 million, etc.)
- Not to mention influencers (YouTube, OnlyFans, etc.), PE firm deals, among many other models

## personal thoughts

- I just loathe when I have a big day ahead of me and instead of doing all the things I want to do, I mindlessly doomscroll the infinitely vast space of media online whether that be Netflix, YouTube, Reddit, etc.
- Why can someone not just make a social media site that does not recommend content to make you stay there? Maybe recommend articles based purely on relevance and embed trust scores depending on an author's reputation (can get hairy I know I know..)?
- If everyone divests attention away from social media, would we be able to form more enriched and connected local communities? I.e. not having people brag about experiences online w/ video/image or checking notifications in the midst of a conversation, etc.
- Our attention is a Markov model itself and it decides what to do based on a weighted combination of a) easiness (i.e. what social media offers) and b) reward (i.e. will I get some dopamine from this or is this transaction worth my time)?
