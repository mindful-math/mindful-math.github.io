A review of the book by Goodfellow et al. titled ["Deep Learning"](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/). 
<!--more-->

## general

2/5 - it lacks exercises, just sprays tidbits of theory like [ESL](https://hastie.su.domains/ElemStatLearn/), is already outdated, and pricey... I can't stand the hype around this book - it's not deserved. The community needs to build exercises and theory together so students can progress without going through PhD programs to waste 5 years reading a few papers and learning nuggets of knowledge from professors/coursework.

**Pros**: He is definitely a collector of theory - lots of interesting ideas (albeit old) are introduced and he does motivate examples quite well.

**Cons**: Exercises & math - rigorously make clear what you are doing. Introduce problems the community still faces; be transparent about what's good and bad in the theories developed; add more exercises and only use math when necessary; motivate the problems through the same lens as the researchers discovering these ideas - do not just drop the theory on the text & paraphrase papers from the 80s...
