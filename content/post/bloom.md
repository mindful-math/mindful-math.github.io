Some shower thoughts and observations on the bloom phase.

## Bloom Phase 
[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjPxGk4ipPk) video is amazing and I try to summarise my findings and mix in with his recommendations.

Tips
* Dripper shape matters a lot; conical drippers need 3-4s of slow pours in the center before starting a circle and winding back to the center to permeate the cofee bed evenly; flat-bed drippers on the other hand have a more even spread of grounds and circle pours are fine from the start
* Speed matters a lot; if you go to fast, the coffee will push a channel through the grounds and you will get an uneven extraction and a sour cup. 
* If you go too slow, you are missing on agitation and will get a sour / watery cup and also uneven extraction as different parts of the bed are in contact with water for varying amounts of time
* Grind size matters a lot; too fine - uneven and water will try going down the sides of the dripper; too coarse - water flys through the bed and an underextracted cup (water-like) with a shallow body will appear
* Time of bloom - shorter -> more sour, less body; longer -> more bitter, bigger body

Todos
* Experiment with the latter two knobs; take out the coffee bed after bloom as he did to see if extraction/flow of water evenly permeates the bed or not
* The number of pours is still questionable; continuous pouring after bloom, 4:6, two pours, three pours, etc. (but bloom is most important to get bed ready)
