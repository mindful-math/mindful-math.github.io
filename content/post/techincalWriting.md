A overview of tricks discussed by Knuth [in this nice piece](https://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/reviewing-papers/knuth_mathematical_writing.pdf).

## do not number lists if information isn't ranked

> Ordered lists are used if there is a logical ordering between bullets (time, importance, score, etc.). Using ordered lists with unordered elements (and vice-versa) can easily confuse the reader.

Hypothesis Testing consists of the following steps:
1. State the null and alternative hypothesis 
2. Collect data (by means of an experiment or by observation)
3. Determine an appropriate test statistic / test based on step 1 & 2
4. Compute the test statistic and p-value 

Here are some tricks for mathematical writing:
+ Separate distinct formulas by words
+ Do not start a sentence with symbols
+ Do not use logical symbols like $\forall, \exists, \therefore$ unless you're working in logic - replace with the corresponding English words "for all", "there exists", "therefore"

**bad**:

## avoid consecutively using "this", "also", "it", etc.

> If repeated too often, a reader can lose track of an author's message. Variable assignment in programming follows a similar cardinal rule - frequent reassignment of variables causes debugging nightmares.

The sum of deleted intervals in the Cantor set is geometrically decaying whose value is computed below:

$$ \sum\limits_{i=0}^\infty \frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^i = \frac{1/3}{1-2/3} = 1.$$

As this sums to one, the Cantor set must have measure zero.

**bad**:

This forms a geometrically decaying series and its sum is given below

$$ \sum\limits_{i=0}^\infty \frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^i = \frac{1/3}{1-2/3} = 1.$$

This shows that this set has measure zero...

## do not use "homework paper" style (i.e. just listing equations)

> While seemingly obvious, I see far too many bland papers with equations/proofs listed. Many readers skim over formulas on their first reading of your text. Commentary interwoven with formulas significantly boosts comprehension. If a formula is truly "trivial" to the target audience, it's fine to exclude this commentary

We can solve this problem by counting. Before painting the exterior of the cube black, there are

- $(n-2)^3$ cubes with zero faces showing
- $6(n-2)^2$ cubes with one face showing
- $4n(n-2)$ cubes with two faces showing
- $8\mathbb{I} \\\{n\geq 2\\\}$ cubes with three faces showing

Each of these $1\times 1\times 1$ sets of cubes can rotate while preserving the exterior color of the $n\times n\times n$ cube:

- If three faces are showing, 3 rotations are possible
- If two faces are showing, 2 rotations are possible
- If one face is showing, 4 rotations are possible
- If no faces are showing, 24 rotations are possible

In general, $n^3$ cubes can be placed in $n^3$ bins with $24$ rotations per cube giving us $24^{n^3}n^3!$ combinations. Thus, we obtain the probability that the exterior color is preserved:

$$\frac{24^{(n-2)^3}(n-2)^3!\times 4^{6(n-2)^2}\left(6(n-2)^2\right)!\times 2^{4n(n-2)}\left(4n(n-2)\right)!\times 3^{8\mathbb{I}\{n\geq 2\}}(8\mathbb{I}\{n\geq 2\})!}{24^{n^3}n^3!}$$

**bad**:

By counting, we obtain the desired probability:

$$ \frac{24^{(n-2)^3}(n-2)^3!\times 4^{6(n-2)^2}\left(6(n-2)^2\right)!\times 2^{4n(n-2)}\left(4n(n-2)\right)!\times 3^{8\mathbb{I}\{n\geq 2\}}(8\mathbb{I}\{n\geq 2\})!}{24^{n^3}n^3!} $$

## donâ€™t use the same notation for two different things (and the converse)

> Notation is really an alphabet and in research, our goal is to use the most common, clear, and concise alphabet to maximize their audience and comprehension.

**good**:

- asdf

**bad**:

- $\log\left(\log(n)\times i\times j\times k\right)=\infty$
- $\log$ has what base ($2$, $e$, etc.)?!? Does $\times$ refer to the cross product and multiplication here?
