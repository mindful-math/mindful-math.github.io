A review of the book by Byrne titled ["The Magic"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magic_(book)).

## general

A bit of a different read from my usual queue, but this book just covers gratitude and why we all need a little more of it in our lives. Some people might roll their eyes (and I did w/ the calligraphy), but she's right about the substance. If we complain all the time, it pushes away others (makes us more negative) and also just shifts our frame of mind to being upset with the current state of things even though there are so many opportunities and things to be grateful for. This book was written before AI slop, mindless social media doomscrolling, and algorithms pitted to maximize your time on the site at the expense of the emotional damage it causes you, but it holds true to this day. Maybe I'm brainwashed, but I feel so much better when I say read a book and tell the author about it or when a coworker does something helpful for me, but people love compliments and everyone is so sparsely complimented as adults in real life - a like on social media does not do the trick. Moreover, it just feels great when you can see a genuine reaction after giving a compliment - it feels like giving a gift. With that said, I will say that she goes overboard with the religious attitude - this is not some magic you should "believe" in, but simply a frame of mind that can help tilt your mind off of some of the recent global struggles humanity faces and constant overbearing negativity and back and forth (largely due to recommendation algorithms and misinformation). She also goes overboard with the list of tasks and assignments - again, this book could be like 10 pages or less (perhaps even an email). I do really agree about being genuine - have you ever had a compliment from someone that wasn't genuine - it is so easy to sniff and just reeks of ass-kissing nonsense that doesn't make either side any bit happier. The point she makes that I agree with is to think hard every now and then about what genuinely is meaningful to you and to try and attribute that to others in your life in the form of compliments/gratitude (books, papers, tasks, etc.). Personally, do not go overboard with compliments - no one is the Messiah or God - they do not need to be showered in compliments - like the scarcity book, it's important to give these out in moderation.

**Pros**: It's just a frame of reference that I think everyone should be adopting these days instead of pitting one against another online and masquerading hate through bots and misinformation.

**Cons**: It's way too verbose. We don't need homework for this. It's not religious and stop trying to make acts of kindness as something you ought to believe in... Gratitude does not solve all your problems so again we don't need 20 chapters saying how it will make those in poverty somehow billionares. These are real issues that take introspection from those in power to resolve.
