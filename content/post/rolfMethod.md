# method

## constants
* 2 pours
* 100ml water each pour
* 10ml / sec pours; i.e. 10s for each 100ml pour
* Roughly 50ml circle, 50ml center pours (variable)
* Second pour starts around the 40 sec mark
* Flatbed (preferably) dripper like the April
* 2 min -> 2 min 30 sec total time (variable)
* Roughly 760 microns (starting grind size for light roasts)

## variables
* center pour = less agitation; i.e. speed up brew time while circle pour agitates more and extends brew a bit longer
* grind size is the main variable to control total brew time; too slow - grind courser and vice-versa
* temperature varies by bean of course; more processed -> 90ish -> less processed -> 94ish
* second pour start time again can control brew time but I find grind size and pour does this equally well (duplicate variable)
* total brew time varies by preference; I find success/tasty cups (personally) w/ shorter 2 min total brews (clear, clean & soft); pushing temp or grind size -> causes excesive astringency I get w/ 4:6 / Hoffman / related pourover strategies and I hate this; much prefer lighter cups over bitterness

## future todos
* play around w/ shower / 2 -> 3 pours w/ shower for less agitation on final pour
* water chemistry; water here is quite hard and I need to play around here
* I am chasing round finishes and this cup generally comes out a touch sour/bitter at end leaving me dissatisfied :(
* pourover rate vs grind size; he does 10ml/s which agitates quick and I wonder what happens if I slow down rate w/ say a shower and tweak grind size
