A rant on finetuning an natural Ethiopian. 
<!--more-->

## background
* The coffee is a natural Ethiopian with strawberry, chocolate, and milk tea notes (supposedly).
* Roaster said that I could brew w/o resting (strange...)
* 1zpresso J grinder; variety of drippers (v60 plastic, origami ceramic, v60 glass)

## parameters
* grind size
* water temperature
* flow rate
* stirring (y/n + when/qty)
* contact time or # of pours
* method (moves many variables - grind, temp, etc.)
* shower drip

## methods
* 5 pour method: Matt Winton
* Hoffman method: James Hoffman (similar w/ Winton)
* 4:6 method: Tetsu Kasuya
* 1:2:1 method: Lance Hedrick
* glitch method: Glitch Roasters

## outcomes
* many disappointing cups
* Stop caring about extraction %. Chasing that seemed to yield the most dissapointing cups w/ this Ethiopian.
* Initial pour smell matters a lot - if there are still bubbles in the second/third pour, you might as well throw out the cup. I was so disappointed because this coffee was quite gaseous. I'm not sure what the roaster was thinking about not letting this rest. The bed would become uneven as gas bubbles popped and led to very uneven, bitter and unpleasant cups
* Shower cap had mixed results. I found it helped w/ the first pour but I think a metal taste lingers - no bueno
* I think for the Ethiopian, I really need much shorter brew times. Anything 2:50 or above tasted quite bitter (could also tweak temperature and other variables)
* Temperature was the most confusing variable - sometimes low was great and it retains the initial aromas of the coffees, but sometimes hot was nice as well. I have to drill into this a bit more when I fix a grindsize
* Grindsize was also confusing - a 204, fine grind w/ 3 pours was quite nice but I couldn't replicate a second time
* Heavily processed coffees (like the ones I got from Glitch) -> 186-189 temp; vary contact time to test
* Ethiopians stalled on the last pour which is why I think it needs to start before 2 min mark.
* Time length of the bloom didn't seem to help w/ anything but I didn't test this in isolation; just a theory
* pour speed was also questionable; not sure how fast I should be going and how it influences the taste
* Even in Japan w/ the best roasters, I wasn't a fan of any Ethiopian coffees I got - too acidic or easy to overextract. I will just get anaerobic naturals or funky ferments because these require much lower extraction %s and have higher probabilities of a tasty cup. This bag wasn't cheap either - like $24 for 300 or so grams.
* I like Columbia lots; huila, paraiso, etc.; Ethiopian coffees are a pain in the butt...
