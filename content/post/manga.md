A review of some recent manga I waste my time reading. 
<!--more-->

## [Kimetsu no Yaiba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon_Slayer:_Kimetsu_no_Yaiba)
3.8/5. I started watching the anime then pivoted to the manga to wrap it up because movie stuff is taking too long. The artwork and soundtrack is just too good - it is decent but nowhere near the godly tier of the anime itself. Ending was a little boring (perhaps just me).

## [Monster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_(manga))
3.5/5. I read this in three days. It starts off with a bang and gets you flipping the pages but then drags on way too long in the middle with a underwhelming finish.

## [Hunter x Hunter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_%C3%97_Hunter)
4.2/5. Probably my favorite shonen - I like the adventure, abilities, nen, etc. and the variety of arcs. But damn, the succession war takes too long, I don't like Kurapika (way too one-dimensional) and he's starting too many subplots without finishing any - dubious we will get a wrap on the series or not in the next few years.
