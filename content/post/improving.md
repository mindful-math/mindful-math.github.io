Some thoughts on progress or lack therof and our world.

## Progress
* Our society is hell bent on education, the next thing, and improvement
* Students are forced to stay in school for longer to be able to extend the work of prior generations
* It pushes back marriage, community, etc. and Pareto wealth will force many to work on prolonging the lives of the wealthy (because we'd rather not tax them...)
* Progress and improvement behaves like Moore's law - really Zeno's paradox: pushing yourself to help society by $1/2^100000$ when you could have just kicked backed and relaxed
* It's ridiculous and I don't want to be a part of it, but some linear combination of a "survival of the fittest"-mentality, consumerism addiction, and Nash equilibrium prevent any alternatives really
* In my mind, it's quite simple. Productivity + people can only improve how resourceful we are with the natural environment and the goods available
* At some point in time, we need to divide these goods and resources and when we add more people but fix resources (a natural constraint on earth), we are forced to cope with shittier lives than those in prior generations all the while being forced to consume and learn X-fold more to move the needle and acquire resources for ourselves
* A hack that I currently abide by is to stop consuming, save & be frugal, and be happy with activities that can be shared amongst each other - climbing, biking, hiking, etc. - all have minimal impacts on the environment but make me fulfilled
* However frugal I am, I think this approach misses out on community that has dissipated in this tech-infused dystopia - fuck these screens - we can get constant dopamine hits from notifications, videos, and content streaming through social media 
* With global tech solutions, we are less meaningful towards each other in our community - who gives AF about joe schmoe next door - I can watch Netflix, shop on Amazon, and write some boilerplate software with Claude Code.
* I don't have an answer but have too much time and ponder quite frequently what is meaninful and worthwhile to do - community is what keeps us alive and motivated but we are losing it and companies are trying to force us to pay for alternatives (modern prostitution - entertainment/movies/etc.)
* This has been a detour from my original article on progress but capture the recurring ideas returning after every dopamine drawn from YouTube slots yippee
