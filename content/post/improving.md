Some thoughts on progress or lack therof and our world. 
<!--more-->

## Progress
* Our society is hell bent on education, the next thing, and improvement
* Students are forced to stay in school for longer to be able to extend the work of prior generations
* It pushes back marriage, community, etc. and Pareto wealth will force many to work on prolonging the lives of the wealthy (because we'd rather not tax them...)
* Progress and improvement behaves like Moore's law - really Zeno's paradox: pushing yourself to help society by $1/2^100000$ when you could have just kicked backed and relaxed
* It's ridiculous and I don't want to be a part of it, but some linear combination of a "survival of the fittest"-mentality, consumerism addiction, and Nash equilibrium prevent any alternatives really
* In my mind, it's quite simple. Productivity + people can only improve how resourceful we are with the natural environment and the goods available
* At some point in time, we need to divide these goods and resources and when we add more people but fix resources (a natural constraint on earth), we are forced to cope with shittier lives than those in prior generations all the while being forced to consume and learn X-fold more to move the needle and acquire resources for ourselves
* A hack that I currently abide by is to stop consuming, save & be frugal, and be happy with activities that can be shared amongst each other - climbing, biking, hiking, etc. - all have minimal impacts on the environment but make me fulfilled
* However frugal I am, I think this approach misses out on community that has dissipated in this tech-infused dystopia - fuck these screens - we can get constant dopamine hits from notifications, videos, and content streaming through social media 
* With global tech solutions, we are less meaningful towards each other in our community - who gives AF about joe schmoe next door - I can watch Netflix, shop on Amazon, and write some boilerplate software with Claude Code.
* I don't have an answer but have too much time and ponder quite frequently what is meaninful and worthwhile to do - community is what keeps us alive and motivated but we are losing it and companies are trying to force us to pay for alternatives (modern prostitution - entertainment/movies/etc.)
* This has been a detour from my original article on progress but capture the recurring ideas returning after every dopamine drawn from YouTube slots yippee

## Progress Pt 2

I am continuing my rant because I think this is important and worth talking about.

1. What is wrong with shrinking hours down to 6 or so per day? People argue about healthcare and fires and what not, but we can have rotations of people like trading desks do or restaurant chains do. This would reduce a lot of the stress each and every one of us feel on a day to day basis. We do valuable things for a few hours and then are able to enjoy the fruits of our labor outside of work. The issue is that people at the top point to China and other nations and want growth - they really shout because they are leveraged in investments that depend on us. FAANG companies are a complete grind right now and won't get better because shareholders want growth which means more manhours and less men working (i.e. efficiency and profit). The issue is that this profit benefits a few and the technologies are locked and guarded so the masses can enjoy them with subscriptions. Ridiculous... The US is becoming more and more like China and many developed countries in Asia rather than its European roots and counterparts. These nations feature people who are just cogs in big machines and work the infamous 9-9 grind 6 days a week. Do we really want or need that to function as a society? Fuck no.

2. Healthcare - in the US, we don't need free healthcare - we need livable wages and less stressful jobs. Then heart disease and a variety of the classic issues Americans face as they encroach their 60s and 70s or later vanish. Having time away from work to hike, bike or travel is healing. Healthcare is REACTIVE not PROACTIVE. I am sick of it... Yes, we do need disease control and a variety of the shots and medicines developed but these institutions make money from rich clients looking for reactive care - restore me to my 20s, give me a new body or face, keep me alive, etc. - this BS is not necessary. Let's pivot discussions to what we can do to curb reactive medicine in the first place - time away from work, livable wages, transportation, etc.
