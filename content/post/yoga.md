## Philosophy and Aim of Yoga

> Man, not satisfied with modern inventions and knowledge of the ever-unfolding mysteries of nature, tirelessly seeks a goal beyond, As he observes nature's miracles through the mysterious atom, the mother of all things; through the stars and planets which, though unlimited, are floating, separating, and crashing into each other in that vast space and time beyond, his intellect refuses to work.
> 
>   This tired intellect, wandering through the galaxies in space and in which our planet is only a minute speck, comes back laden with disappointment and shame.
