A review of the infamous book by Levitt called ["Freakonomics"](https://freakonomics.com/). 
<!--more-->

## general

**Pros**:

- The first two chapters: incentives and informational asymmetry. This stuff is fun to reflect on and think about in your own life.
- Bubblegum read: good flow with simple language (but misleading - missing out on a lot of important statistics and assumptions to reach your conclusions professor...)

**Cons**: 

- The last four chapters (maybe publisher requirements to not only be a 50-page excerpt)
- I am annoyed by economics. It's like playing connect the dots with an infinitude of confounding variables and no LEGITIMATE "laws" can be obtained from some gimmicky surveys collected with 20 data points.
- Abortion is one explanation - sure. But you're ignoring the zillion other events ongoing - what about the internet, parental styles, educational reforms, etc.?
- High finance (and dare I say any large F500 company these days) is organized (salary-wise) just like a gang with executives making orders of magnitude more, but with less contributions to bottom line (than drug dealers)
- The parenting sections (5 & 6) were so unbelievably disorganized. He just listed names and strawman arguments - like dude, what if a person's success is spent by the percentage of time spent hanging out with successful people (in whatever measure you care about)?

## quotes

> Economics is, at root, the study of incentives: how people get what they want, or need, especially when other people want or need the same thing (page 20)
> An incentive is simply a means of urging people to do more of a good thing and less of a bad thing (page 21)
> Who cheats? Well, just about anyone, if the stakes are right (page 24)
> Cheating is a primordial economic act: getting more for less (page 25)
