## new

- The Briochi quintic: $X^5 + 10BX^3 + 45B^2X + B^2 = 0$

## review
- Icosahedrons; totally forgot what these guys looked like
- I remembered how to derive the formula for the roots of a quadratic lol. Take any quadratic like $x^2 + ax + b$, then complete the square to get $(x+\frac{a}{2})^2 + (b- \frac{a^2}{4})$. Set this to zero and solve to get 
$$x=\pm\sqrt{\frac{a^2-4b}{4}}-\frac{a}{2}=\frac{-a\pm \sqrt{a^2-4b}}{2}.$$
- What about the cubic $x^3+ax+b$?
