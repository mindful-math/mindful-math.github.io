A review of the book by Levitt titled ["Supernormal Stimuli"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernormal_Stimuli).

## general

The book remarks that humans are naturally drawn to outliers - abnormal colors, shapes, sounds, smells, etc. and argues that marketing and modern capitalism and consumerism has kept pushing the boundary so much so that news and everything these days is so out of the ordinary and just not real. Examples discussed include pornography, social media, and examples drawn from biologists studying other animals. She argues that our phones and devices in particular have stolen so much of our time and attention and are catalyzing the loneliness epidemic. Hours of doomscrolling and videos only make you feel dull inside and make your environment seem boring - these companies are drug dealers - the modern day form of smoking is wasting hours sitting down not engaging with peers and your local communities.

**Pros**: I find the argument fascinating and strikes a chord with some earlier thoughts I had on stars and social media. The parallels/examples drawn from biology were quite interesting but that wraps up the pros...

**Cons**: However appealing, I wish the author prescribed an antidote - like yes doomscrolling is bad and watching YouTube/Netflix/Instagram is not healthy in large doses, but is there a way to fix it aside from cold-turkey unplugging. Like modern day society imposes requirements to have phones for authentication and communication and directions. Another thing - she is a scientist and a professor at Harvard - stop with the bubblegum anecdotes and bring in the research papers, studies, and proof. You don't need 200+ pages of garbage stories to reinforce your idea - I get it, now talk about what to do...

## quotes

> Yet each [episode], after 30-60 minutes of the illusion of social contact, left you no richer in real friendship or family ties to support you in crisis and yet eager to tune in the following episode...

> Saying that pornography creates a desire for…trashy sex is like saying McDonald’s creates a desire for salty, greasy meat. Hugh Hefner did not invent the American fetish for women with large breasts; his Playmate of the month merely exploited a taste already well-established.
