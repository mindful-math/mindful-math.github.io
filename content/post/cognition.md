* I can't tell you how many times I just want to throw my computer out the window and just read books all day. It suuuuuucks to stare at screens, jigger your mouse, exchange pleasantries with people who view you exclusively as expenses, and doomscroll on all the latest and greatest content I am missing out on.
* Fuck it - I'm not missing out on shit and I don't care - just let me spend a few hours implementing high quality code and give me the rest of the day to read, write papers, etc. all on paper and other mediums - diversity of landscape is extremely important.

Here are some AI use cases I really want to make work:
- I have a script to use the archive to just grab text from an html page. I would like to remove randomness from this and have the LLM tighten up the language.
- I would like all of my queries to the LLM to become quizzes and have it teach me or recommend resources I can marinate in to learn the content well through problems and exercises. Example: I keep asking syntax for certain MongoDB aggregations or Lean tactics - quiz me on these later - force me to recall what I asked and make the game less seamless and queries more difficult. This would be a very powerful mechanism where the two of us (man and LLM) synergistically cooperate to resolve challenges I face on a day to day basis. This progress though sadly would just lead to more and more work... welp - that's a tad bit defeatist.
