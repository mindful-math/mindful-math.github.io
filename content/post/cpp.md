A review of the book by Torsten Will titled ["C++: The Comprehensive Guide"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernormal_Stimuli).

## general

2.5/5. It reads terribly - not intended to be read cover to cover (as I did this past month). Some parts are quite useful on modern C++ syntax and details but most is just like AI/NPC-generated text on concepts you can find in more detail skimming the docs. He covers statements and control flow in so much detail and then testing and templating is left up as exercises to the reader (not really, but it felt like it). It honestly reads like a bunch of blog posts strung together by a busy engineer (oh wait that's what I do...) and not the quality I hoped for - no magnum opus. I wished he would interject with more exercises for readers (to test they are listening) and drop the dumb tables and code samples for more professional and polished ones or links to repos (I don't need to see Fibonacci numbers every 10 pages). Oh and I was also interested to see how he would cover threading - it was painfully boring and lacking in detail. I may recommend begineer C++ engineers skim through to discover topics but even then there are so many more high quality cpp references online and by the creators themselves...
